# Anomaly Detection and Predictive Analysis in Aquaponics Fish Farming Using Sensor Data
 This project investigates the application of machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and predictive analytics in aquaponics systems, with a focus on key water quality parameters. Initial exploratory data analysis identified significant trends and irregularities, revealing correlations between water quality features and fish growth. LSTM, GRU, and Hybrid LSTM with autoencoder models were selected and meticulously tuned using k-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter optimization. The models were evaluated and the LSTM with autoencoder was found to outperform others, although the GRU model also demonstrated strong potential. Predictive analytics was further enhanced by using a custom Conv1D-based window generator, which effectively captured temporal dependencies in the data. Efforts at temperature prediction, where the models achieved notable success. The findings highlight the robustness of LSTM-based models in complex environments, offering valuable insights for optimizing aquaponics operations. The research underscores the potential for machine learning to enhance predictive capabilities, ensuring better monitoring and management of aquaponics systems.
